If you are using VS Code you can use the debugger configured in the [launch](.vscode/launch.json) file. However, for using the debugger you have to download the [Microsoft Edge Tools for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-edgedevtools.vscode-edge-devtools) extension and the [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge) browser. Then run
```
cd frontend
ng serve
```
and start the Launch Edge against localhost debugger.
